# MOSNet
Implementation of  "MOSNet: Deep Learning based Objective Assessment for Voice Conversion"
https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08352

# Dependency
Linux Ubuntu 16.04
- GPU: GeForce RTX 2080 Ti
- Driver version: 418.67
- CUDA version: 10.1

Python 3.5
- tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0-beta1 (cudnn=7.6.0)
- scipy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- librosa

### Environment set-up
For example,
```
conda create -n mosnet python=3.5
conda activate mosnet
pip install -r requirements.txt
conda install cudnn=7.6.0
```

# Usage

1. `cd ./data` and run `bash download.sh` to download the VCC2018 evaluation results and submitted speech. (downsample the submitted speech might take some times)
2. Run `python mos_results_preprocess.py` to prepare the evaluation results. (Run `python bootsrap_estimation.py` to do the bootstrap experiment for intrinsic MOS calculation)
3. Run `python utils.py` to extract .wav to .h5
4. Run `python train.py --model CNN-BLSTM` to train a CNN-BLSTM version of MOSNet. ('CNN', 'BLSTM' or 'CNN-BLSTM' are supported in model.py, as described in paper)
5. Run `python test.py` to test on the pre-trained weights with specified model and weight.



# Evaluation Results

The model is trained on the large listening evaluation results released by the Voice Conversion Challenge 2018.

The listening test results can be downloaded from [here](https://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/3257)

The databases and results (submitted speech) can be downloaded from [here](https://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/3061)
